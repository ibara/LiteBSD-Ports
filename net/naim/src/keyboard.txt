To know what will happen if you hit a specific key on your keyboard
right now, use the command `/bind` to see the full list of keybindings

KEY NAMES.

To bind a key when pressed with the control key, prepend the
letter on that key with a ^
To bind a key when pressed with the alt or meta key, prepend
the letter on that key with a M-
If the key is to be pressed with alt and meta, prepend the
letter on the key with M-^

Capitalization of key names does not count.

These are some cryptically named keys
DC = the delete key (not the backspace key)
IC = the insert key
NPAGE = page down
PPAGE = page up

Here are other useful keys that should be self explanatory.
TAB SPACE ESCAPE DOWN UP LEFT RIGHT HOME BACKSPACE ENTER END BTAB
There are other weird keys that you can look up in the source code
in conio_keys.h if your keyboard has weird keys.

KEYBINDING COMMANDS.
You can execute the following commands (I call them :commands)
as the result of a key press. You an also execute /commands
(see /help commands) for more information.

:BUDDY_NEXT                       Move to the previous and next buddies
:BUDDY_PREV                       in your buddy list.

:BUDDY_SCROLL_BACK                These scroll the conversation window
:BUDDY_SCROLL_FORWARD             forward and backward by a page, so
                                  you can see what you and your buddy 
                                  said earlier in the conversation.

:CONN_NEXT                        Move to the previous and next 
:CONN_PREV                        connections in your buddy list

:INPUT_BACKSPACE                  General editing keys while you're
:INPUT_CURSOR_END                 composing lines to send.
:INPUT_CURSOR_HOME                :INPUT_ENTER sends the message
:INPUT_CURSOR_HOME_END
:INPUT_CURSOR_LEFT
:INPUT_CURSOR_RIGHT
:INPUT_DELETE
:INPUT_ENTER

:INPUT_ENT_BOLD            Bold and Italic formatting
:INPUT_ENT_ITALIC

:INPUT_KILL                Erases everything on the current input line
:INPUT_KILL_EOL            Erases everything after the cursor
:INPUT_KILL_WORD           Erases the whole word, but only up to the 
                           cursor. (To erase a whole word, put the 
                           cursor in the space immediately preceding
                           that word.)
                           

:INPUT_PASTE               Using this command enters paste mode, 
                           where you may enter a long multi-line 
                           message. To send that message, hit the
                           paste-mode key again, then hit your usual
                           send key (:INPUT_ENTER)

:INPUT_SCROLL_BACK         These two commands can be used to scroll
:INPUT_SCROLL_FORWARD      through a history of what you have typed
                           on the input line, so you can send those
                           lines of text, or enter the same commands
                           again.

:INPUT_SYM_AMP             The ampersand, greater than, and less than
:INPUT_SYM_GT              symbols have special uses in HTML. Because
:INPUT_SYM_LT              naim uses HTML for formatting, naim is bound 
                           by default so that < > and & generate the
                           correct HTML codes to show a literal < > or &
                           These are the commands behind that binding.

:REDRAW                    This redraws the screen

:SPACE_OR_NBSP             This inserts a space on the input line
                           (by default, it is bound to the space bar)

:STATUS_DISPLAY            Displays the status window until you hit
                           :STATUS_DISPLAY again

:STATUS_POKE               Displays the status window for a few seconds

:TAB                       I haven't figured out how :TAB_BUDDY_NEXT is
:TAB_BUDDY_NEXT            different from :BUDDY_NEXT, but :TAB is the 
                           will insert the HTML control codes for 5 
                           non-breaking spaces into your input line,
                           so that you can 

:WINLIST_HIDE              Would you like to see the buddy list? This 
                           toggles through its three states: always 
                           visible, always hidden, and auto-hiding
