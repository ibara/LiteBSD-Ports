.SH NAME
ii \- irc it or irc improved

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ii
is a minimalistic FIFO and filesystem based IRC client.
It creates an irc directory tree with server, channel and
nick name directories.
In every directory a FIFO file (in) and and normal file (out)
is placed. This will be for example ~/irc/irc.freenode.net/.
The in file is used to communicate with the servers and the out
files includes the server messages. For every channel and every nick
name there will be new in and out files.
The basic idea of this is to be able to communicate with an IRC
server with basic command line tools.
For example if you will join a channel just do echo "/j #channel" > in
and ii creates a new channel directory with in and out file.

In this directory the irc tree will be created. In this directory you
will find a directory for your server (default: irc.freenode.net) in
which the FIFO and the output file will be stored.
If you join a channel a new directory with the name of the channel
will be created in the ~/irc/$servername/ directory.
