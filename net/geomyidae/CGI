INTRODUCTION

Geomyidae has support for running scripts on each request, which will generate
dynamic content.

There are two modes: standard cgi and dynamic cgi.
(»CGI« as name was just taken, because that's easier to compare to the web.)


PERMISSIONS

The scripts are run using the permissions of geomyidae. It is adivsed to use
the -g and -u option of gemoyidae.


BEFOREHAND

In these examples C: is what the client sends and S: what the server is
sending.


CALLING CONVENTION

Geomyidae will call the script like this:

	% $gopherroot/test.cgi $search $arguments $host $port

When it is a plain request, the arguments will have these values:

	C: /test.cgi
	-> $search = "" 
	-> $arguments = "" 
	-> $host = server host
	-> $port = server port

If the request is for a type 7 search element, then the entered string by
the user will be seen as following:

	C: /test.cgi	searchterm		(There is a Tab inbetween)
	-> $search = »searchterm«
	-> $arguments = ""
	-> $host = server host
	-> $port = server port 

When you are trying to give your script some calling arguments, the syntax
is:

	C: /test.cgi?hello
	-> $search = ""
	-> $arguments = »hello«
	-> $host = server host
	-> $port = server port

If borth ways of input are combined, the variables are set as following:

	C: /test.cgi?hello=world	searchterm	(Beware! A Tab!)
	-> $search = »searchterm«
	-> $arguments = »hello=world«
	-> $host = server host
	-> $port = server port


STANDARD CGI

The file extension »cgi« switches to this mode, where the output of the
script is not interpreted at all by the server and the script needs to send
raw content.

	% cat test.cgi
	#!/bin/sh
	echo "Hello my friend."
	%

The client will receive:

	S: Hello my friend.


DYNAMIC CGI

For using dynamic CGI, the file needs to end in »dcgi«, which will switch on
the interpretation of the returned lines by the script. The interpreted for-
mat is the same as in the *.gph files.

	% cat test.dcgi
	#!/bin/sh
	echo "[1|Some link|/somewhere|server|port]"
	%

Here geomyidae will interpret the *.gph format and return the valid gopher
menu item.

	S: 1Some link	/somewhere	gopher.r-36.net	70


Have fun!
